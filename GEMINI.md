# 🚀 PROJECT BLUEPRINT: THE CROSS-BORDER ARCHITECT PORTFOLIO

## 1. IDENTITY & ROLE
You are a **Senior Creative Developer & UI/UX Design Specialist**. Your objective is to build an "Elite-Tier" portfolio for a Software Engineer (Bachelor of Computer Science) who has completed 15+ international projects for SMEs in Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore.

## 2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
- **No Mediocrity:** Avoid generic developer templates (no boring white cards, no standard headers).
- **Visual "Gahar":** The design must be aggressive, sophisticated, and high-end. Think "Apple meet Cyberpunk" but professional.
- **Business Impact:** Don't just show code; show solutions for ERP, POS, E-commerce, and Company Profiles.

## 3. LATEST TECH STACK (STRICT)
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (Latest stable/RC) + React 19.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0 (Alpha/Latest) for maximum performance.
- **Animations:** - **GSAP:** For complex, high-performance scroll-triggered animations.
  - **Framer Motion:** For micro-interactions and smooth UI transitions.
- **3D/Graphics:** React Three Fiber (Three.js) for the interactive global footprint.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript (Strict Mode).

## 4. DESIGN SYSTEM & VISUALS
- **Color Palette:** "Deep Obsidian" (#050505) as primary, with "Cyber Emerald" or "Electric Blue" as glowing accents.
- **Typography:** Use high-end variable fonts like "Geist Sans", "Clash Display", or "Inter Tight".
- **Layout:**
  - **Hero:** Kinetic Typography that reacts to mouse movement.
  - **Work:** Asymmetrical Bento Grid 2.0 with glassmorphism and depth (parallax).
  - **Global Map:** A 3D Point-Cloud Globe at the bottom. Countries (ID, VN, JP, MY, SG) must "Glow" and show project stats on hover.

## 5. PROJECT DATA (FOR CONTEXT)
- **Total Projects:** 15 Real-world SME Projects.
- **Target Countries:** Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore.
- **Categories:** ERP Systems, POS Solutions, E-commerce, High-end Company Profiles.
- **SEO Strategy:** Implement JSON-LD for "Professional Service" and "SoftwareSourceCode". Focus on international keywords.

## 6. CODING GUIDELINES
- Use **Atomic Design** or **Feature-based structure**.
- Every component must be **Server Component** by default, unless interactivity is required.
- Prioritize **Lighthouse 100/100** scores (Performance, Accessibility, SEO).
- Implement custom hooks for GSAP animations to keep code clean.

## 7. EXECUTION COMMANDS FOR GEMINI CLI
When I ask you to generate a component, always refer back to this GEMINI.md to ensure the visual style remains "Outstanding" and "Gahar".

## 8. ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE & NAVIGATION
- **Project Deep-Dive:** Implement Next.js **Intercepting Routes** and **Parallel Routes**. Clicking a project card should open an overlay (modal-like) for quick viewing, but refreshing the page or deep-linking should land on a dedicated, SEO-optimized full page.
- **Workflow Section:** Create a "System Flow" visualization (Discovery -> Architecture -> Development -> Global Launch) using SVG paths and GSAP scroll-trigger animations.
- **Tech Dashboard:** Instead of simple icons, build a "System Status" dashboard displaying the tech stack with radar charts or HUD-style progress bars.

## 9. GLOBAL CREDIBILITY & SOCIAL PROOF
- **Localized Testimonials:** Show client feedback categorized by country flags (ID, VN, JP, MY, SG).
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Prepare the architecture for Multi-language support (English, Indonesian, Japanese) using `next-intl` or similar.
- **SEO Mastery:** Every project page must include dynamic OpenGraph images and JSON-LD for "SoftwareSourceCode" to dominate search results in all 5 target countries.

## 10. REFINED FINISHING
- **Custom Cursor:** Implement a "Magnetic Cursor" that changes shape when hovering over projects or the 3D Globe.
- **Film Grain Overlay:** Apply a subtle noise texture to the entire body to eliminate the "flat" digital look.
- **Performance Budget:** Ensure every route transition is handled by GSAP for a "Zero-Jank" experience.

## 11. CONTACT & CONVERSION (THE COMMAND CENTER)
- **Style:** "Terminal-Inspired Command Center". Use monospaced fonts for labels and a sleek, high-contrast input design.
- **Interactivity:** Every input focus must trigger a subtle "glow" effect on the borders (Conic-gradient).
- **Global Context:** Include a "World Clock" widget showing current times in ID, VN, JP, MY, and SG to emphasize international availability.
- **Technical:** Use Next.js Server Actions for form submission with a high-end "Success" animation (e.g., a "Data Sent" terminal sequence).

## 12. NAVIGATION & UX (THE ADAPTIVE HUD)
- **Floating Navbar:** Create a minimal, glassmorphism-style floating navigation.
- **Scroll Indicator:** Add a thin neon progress bar at the top/bottom of the navbar to indicate scroll depth.
- **Features:** Links to (Work, Process, Status, Contact) + a "System Export" button for CV download.
- **Logic:** Hide navbar on scroll down, show on scroll up (Smart Navbar).

## 13. IDENTITY & HUMAN FACTOR (THE ARCHITECT)
- **Bio Section:** Position a high-impact "Architect Profile" section after the Hero. 
- **Content:** Highlight "Bachelor of Computer Science" and the mindset of bridging Business SME with High-Level Engineering.
- **Visual:** Use a high-contrast, black-and-white professional photo with a subtle "Glitch" or "Scanline" effect to match the theme.

## 14. PERFORMANCE & POLISH (THE ZERO-JANK)
- **Terminal Pre-loader:** Implement a "System Booting" sequence to mask the loading of Three.js assets and heavy animations.
- **Animation Throttling:** Use GSAP ScrollTrigger `toggleActions` to ensure animations only play when in view and kill them when out of view to save GPU.
- **Accessibility:** Add a "Reduce Motion" toggle for users who prefer static layouts.

## 15. NAVIGATION REFACTOR (FINAL FIX)
- **Responsiveness:** Implement a Mobile Hamburger Menu using Framer Motion (Slide-in or Full-screen overlay).
- **Functionality:** - Connect links to Section IDs (#hero, #work, #map, #contact) using Smooth Scroll.
  - Implement a "Glass-morphism Mobile Menu" for smaller screens.
  - Active State: The nav links must glow when the user is in that specific section (Intersection Observer).
